Using the SAPUI5 SearchField widget to expose the SAP Developer Network forum info. Simple use case of the widget showing the suggestion list populated as you type. The initial version started suggestions after the first two characters, matching at the start of the string. After an update from https://github.com/esjewett we now are matching anywhere in the string.
